Imagine we have data from a store. The data lists a Sales trend color and Revenue for 500 consecutive days.

Please perform your analysis in a Jupyter Notebook in Python.


1. Import data sets (Test_data1 and Test_data2)

	*Done in Jupyter notebook
		1) Test_data1 is a .csv
			a) data = pd.read_csv('Test_data1.csv') 
		2) Test_data2 is a .txt 
			a) data = pd.read_csv('Test_data2.txt)

2. Describe any issues with either data set.

	*Issues with "Test_data1.csv" 
		1) Sales.column contained the following "Green, Yellow, Red,'blank','fhhedk' 
			a) 2 variables to be cleaned first 'blank' 
			b) second 'fhhedk' (presumed it was a typo) 
		2) Date.column had the .dtype as 'object', I went ahead and converted to date 

	*Issues with "Test_data2.txt" 
		1) File was .txt, I converted to .csv to make things easier 
		2) Text delimiter used was '|' (pipes), I separated it via the delimiter to properly appear in df(data frame)
		3) Revenue.column was object data type, converted to int(integer)
		4) Random input was found in Revenue.column "@#$%%#@$$" 


3. Propose a mathematical relationship to explain Revenue for any date. You are free to make any assumptions in order to produce a relationship. Please show and describe all intermediate steps and exploratory analyses.

	*Refer to supplemented documentation
